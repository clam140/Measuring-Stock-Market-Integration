# Measuring Stock Market Integration With Respect to Developed and Emerging Economies

This is my capstone project for the BA degree at Willamette University in Economics. I used Granger-Causality tests on five international stock market indices to capture predictive causality between their movements, with a specific focus on the relationships between the indices of developed markets and emerging markets. The full/final thesis is available in PDF format. 

Feel free to view the thesis and check out the R script!

Note: the "leadConditions.csv" file is used within the R script to indicate whether to correct the model for time-zone discreptancies within the markets.
