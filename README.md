# Measuring Stock-Market Integration With Respect to Developed and Emerging Economies

This is my capstone project for the BA degree at Willamette University in Economics. I use Granger-Causality tests on five stock market indices. 
Since the project is not due for evaluation yet, I won't push the final paper and results yet until May. But the thesis proposal and script used 
in the analysis can be viewed now!

Note: the "leadConditions.csv" file is used within the R script to indicate whether to correct the model for time-zone discreptancies within the markets.
